Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
But really, I was doing just fine without ya
Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You running outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (bed)
Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (yeah, yeah, oh-oh)
Making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)

Nah-nah-nah (ayy, beautiful)
Making beautiful mistakes

Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (wow)
Just like she already owned it
I said, 'can you give it back to me?'
She said, 'never in your wildest dreams'
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her

Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
